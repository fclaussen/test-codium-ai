# QA Strategy

## Introduction

The purpose of this QA strategy is to outline the approach and activities that will be undertaken to ensure the quality of our software product. This strategy will guide the QA team in planning, executing, and reporting on the testing efforts throughout the development lifecycle.

## Test Planning

Before the start of each development cycle, the QA team will collaborate with the development team to define the scope of testing, identify test objectives, and establish test priorities. Test planning will involve creating test plans, test cases, and test data, as well as determining the required test environments and resources.

## Test Execution

During the test execution phase, the QA team will execute the planned tests, record test results, and report any defects found. The team will follow a structured approach to ensure comprehensive coverage of functional and non-functional requirements. Test execution will be performed in multiple iterations, with each iteration focusing on specific areas of the application.

## Defect Management

Defect management is a critical aspect of the QA strategy. The QA team will use a defect tracking system to log, track, and prioritize defects. Defects will be categorized based on severity and impact, and appropriate actions will be taken to address them. The team will work closely with the development team to ensure timely resolution of defects and retesting of fixed issues.

## Conclusion

By following this QA strategy, we aim to deliver a high-quality software product that meets the expectations of our stakeholders. The strategy will be continuously reviewed and updated throughout the project to adapt to changing requirements and improve the overall quality of the product.
